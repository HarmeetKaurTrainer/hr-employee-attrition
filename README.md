Employee attrition is predictable under stable circumstances, wherein a set pattern can be deduced from certain parameters influencing the employee and the organization at all times. Some of these parameters could be foreseeable such as retirement age or unforeseeable such as company performance, external funding, management shakeup etc.

However, who is going to leave, when and why, can be answered based on analytical models developed as a result of data analysis.

On a basic level, the model works by clustering/ classifying employee profiles based on various attributes such as age, sex, marital status, education level, work experience, distance from hometown, etc. and generates various levels of risk of attrition. Occasionally, other parameters like performance over the years, pay raise, work batch, educational institution are also taken into consideration.

However, the accuracy of the model is directly proportional to the selection of parameters, which in turn, leads to the generation of the ‘type’ of predictive model most suitable for the organization.

## OUTPUT

The output depends on the chosen model. 

For instance, ‘**logistic model**’ produces scorecards for employees based on their predicted ‘attrition risk’ parameters; while the **classification model** catalogues the employees into wider parameters, such as-more likely or less likely to quit, high risk or low risk, etc.

However, the bottom line is to keep it simple enough for HR managers to understand and implement accordingly. Changing the various factors help in assessing the impact of changes and making the right decisions.

# Benefits of Predicting Attrition Model
-   Analysis and assessment of the loss in expertise and skillsets
-   Minimize cost of new talent acquisition based on the employee profiling and company requirements
-   Measurement of financial and productivity loss due to attrition
-   Able to plan and minimize the loss
-   Evaluation of employee requirements, their strengths and weaknesses
-   Able to prepare contingency plans 

# Conclusion
Attrition Model helps in not only taking preventive measures but also into making better hiring decisions. 

Deriving trends in the candidate’s performance out of past data is important in order to predict the future trends, as well as to board new employees. Moreover, HR can use the employee data to predict attrition, the possible reasons behind it and can take appropriate measures to prevent it.
